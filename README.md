# Capstone 1
EDA, Graphs, and Hypothesis Tests
<hr>

## Proposal 1
**Dataset:** [Ethereum Block Data](https://www.kaggle.com/muhammedabdulazeem/ethereum-block-data)

This dataset has 16 columns and 4.3M+ rows of data. I'd like to make hypothesis tests about the time it takes to create a new ETH, transaction costs, and gas prices. I believe the data will yield some nice graphs and hopefully some meaningful insights into the evolution of the ETH network.

## Proposal 2
**Dataset:** [NFL Play by Play Data](https://www.kaggle.com/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present)

This dataset has NFL play by play data from 2004-present. I'd like to do a variety of tests that should reveal metrics for fantasy football player value like how well does combine scores predict average fantasy score, how many downs each team averages per possession, how plays per possession relate to player scores, etc.

## Proposal 3
**Dataset:** [Call of Duty Player Skills](https://www.kaggle.com/aishahakami/call-of-duty-players)

This dataset has data from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare players, and I'd like to build hypothesis tests targeting how to think about player types in Call of Duty. I'd like to answer questions like how killstreaks and kill/death ratios are related.
